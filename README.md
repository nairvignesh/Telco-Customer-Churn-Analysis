# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom industry. In this project, I analyzed a telecom dataset to understand why customers leave and what factors influence their decision to stay. Out of all users, **26.54%** have churned — that's more than 1 in every 4 customers!
